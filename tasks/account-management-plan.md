# Account Management Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the plan for implementing customer account management features in our Next.js application integrated with Shopify's Storefront API.

## Research Findings

### Shopify Customer Authentication Options

#### 1. Shopify Storefront API Customer Authentication
- The Storefront API provides endpoints for customer authentication
- We can use the `customerAccessTokenCreate` mutation to authenticate customers
- Access tokens are valid for a limited time and need to be refreshed
- This approach requires us to build our own authentication UI and logic

#### 2. Shopify Multipass
- Allows for single sign-on (SSO) between our application and Shopify
- Requires Shopify Plus subscription
- Good option if we already have an existing authentication system

#### 3. Shopify Customer Accounts API (Beta)
- New API specifically for headless commerce
- Provides more flexibility and features than the Storefront API
- Currently in beta, may have limitations

## Recommended Approach
For our Next.js application, the most straightforward approach is to use the Shopify Storefront API for customer authentication. This gives us:

1. Direct integration with our existing Storefront API setup
2. Full control over the authentication UI and user experience
3. No additional subscription requirements (unlike Multipass)

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. GraphQL Queries and Mutations
- [ ] Define customer authentication queries/mutations
  - [ ] customerAccessTokenCreate (login)
  - [ ] customerCreate (registration)
  - [ ] customerAccessTokenRenew (token refresh)
  - [ ] customerRecover (password reset)
  - [ ] customerReset (password reset completion)
  - [ ] customerUpdate (profile update)
  - [ ] customerAddressCreate (add address)
  - [ ] customerAddressUpdate (update address)
  - [ ] customerAddressDelete (delete address)
  - [ ] customerDefaultAddressUpdate (set default address)

### 2. Server Actions
- [ ] Create server actions for authentication operations
  - [ ] loginCustomer
  - [ ] registerCustomer
  - [ ] requestPasswordReset
  - [ ] resetPassword
  - [ ] updateCustomerProfile
  - [ ] getCustomerOrders
  - [ ] manageCustomerAddresses

### 3. API Routes
- [ ] Create API routes for client-side authentication
  - [ ] /api/account/login
  - [ ] /api/account/register
  - [ ] /api/account/password-reset
  - [ ] /api/account/profile
  - [ ] /api/account/orders
  - [ ] /api/account/addresses

### 4. Authentication Context
- [ ] Create customer authentication context
  - [ ] Customer state management
  - [ ] Login/logout functionality
  - [ ] Token storage and renewal
  - [ ] Authentication status checks

### 5. UI Components
- [ ] Login form
- [ ] Registration form
- [ ] Password reset form
- [ ] Account dashboard
- [ ] Profile edit form
- [ ] Order history list
- [ ] Order detail view
- [ ] Address book management

### 6. Pages
- [ ] /account/login
- [ ] /account/register
- [ ] /account/password-reset
- [ ] /account/dashboard
- [ ] /account/profile
- [ ] /account/orders
- [ ] /account/orders/[id]
- [ ] /account/addresses

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of authentication tokens
- CSRF protection for authentication forms
- Proper validation of user inputs
- Secure handling of password reset flows
- Rate limiting for authentication attempts

## Next Steps
1. Define the GraphQL queries and mutations
2. Create the authentication context provider
3. Implement server actions for authentication
4. Build the authentication UI components
5. Create the account pages
