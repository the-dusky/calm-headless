- [x] Create or reuse a ProductCard component for consistent product display
- [ ] Add sorting and filtering options (optional, for future enhancement)
- [x] Implement pagination for large product catalogs
- [x] Add loading states and error handling
- [x] Connect product cards to their respective product detail pages
- [x] Test the home page with various screen sizes and product quantities

### Completed Implementation
We successfully implemented a responsive product grid on the home page that displays products from the Shopify store. The implementation includes:

1. **Product Grid**: Created a responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes (4 columns on desktop, 3 on medium screens, 2 on small screens, and 1 on mobile).

2. **Data Fetching**: Used the existing `useProducts` hook from the Shopify library to fetch products with pagination support.

3. **UI Components**: 
   - Reused the existing `ProductCard` component for consistent product display
   - Added loading states with animated spinners
   - Implemented error handling with user-friendly error messages
   - Added a "Load More" button for pagination

4. **User Experience**:
   - Clear navigation to product details
   - Visual indicators for loading states
   - Responsive design for all device sizes

### Next Steps
1. Implement sorting and filtering options for the product grid
2. Create a dedicated cart page to handle the redirect from product pages
3. Add product search functionality to the home page

### Technical Notes
- The build process required clearing the Next.js cache to resolve module loading issues
- We maintained the existing site structure while adding the new product grid functionality
- The home page now serves as both a product catalog and an introduction to the Calm Outdoors brand
