feat: add product grid to home page

Implemented a responsive product grid on the home page to allow users to browse all products without using the calendar interface. Features include:

- Responsive grid layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Pagination with "Load More" functionality
- Loading states and error handling
- Direct navigation to product detail pages
- Reused existing ProductCard component for consistency

This change provides an alternative browsing experience while maintaining the existing calendar-based shipping interface.

Changelog: Added v0.2.1 entry
